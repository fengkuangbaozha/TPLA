#  Same Species Lift Over procedure, the first step: run.blat procedure
#  query and target sequences are chunked up into smaller pieces
#  each query chunk is run with blat against each target chunk
#  the result of this is a number of psl output files which are
#  chained together in the run.chain second procedure.

#  ASSUMPTION HERE ! - this is for simple small genome sequences,
#        small as in several 10's of million bases.  Larger genome sequences
#        require a cluster computer to run 10's of thousands of blat jobs.
#        and some different parameters on the chunking operation, not
#        listed here.

#  Buyer Beware - this was written without being tested, it may have errors.
#        The general theme and procedure is correct, some specifics may be off.

#       exit on any error

# First part of the procedure is a blat run between target and query chunks
# decide on a work-directory where this will take place:
export workDirectory="/some/path/to/work/area"
# two directories will be created here where work-steps take place:

mkdir -p ${workDirectory}/run.blat ${workDirectory}/run.chain

# the resulting liftOver chain file will end up in ${workDirectory}/

# location where your two .2bit files are located:
export twoBitDirectory="/some/path/to/two/bit/files"
